    "#\n",
    "# The spell-checking itself is carried out using a modified version\n",
    "# of the Viterbi algorithm, which yields the most likely sequence of\n",
    "# hidden states, i.e. the most likely sequence of words that form a\n",
    "# sentence. The main difference to the 'standard' Viterbi algorithm\n",
    "# is that the state space (i.e. the list of possible corrections) is\n",
    "# generated (and therefore varies) for each word. This is in contrast\n",
    "# to the alternative of considering the state space of all possible\n",
    "# words in the dictionary for every word that is checked, which would\n",
    "# be intractable for larger dictionaries.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm is best illustrated by way of an example.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Suppose that we are checking the sentence 'This is ax test.'\n",
    "# The emissions for the entire sentence are 'This is ax test.' and\n",
    "# the hidden states for the entire sentence are 'This is a test.'\n",
    "#\n",
    "# As a pre-processing step, we convert everything to lowercase,\n",
    "# eliminate punctuation, and break the sentence up into a list of\n",
    "# words: ['this', 'is', 'ax', 'text']\n",
    "# This list is passed as a parameter to the viterbi function.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm tackles each word in turn, starting with 'this'.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We first use get_suggestions to obtain a list of all words that\n",
    "# may have been intended instead of 'this', i.e. all possible hidden\n",
    "# states (intended words) for the emission (word typed).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# get_suggestions returns the 10 most likely corrections:\n",
    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",
    "#   ['this']\n",
    "# - 3 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['his', 'thus', 'thin']\n",

    "#   ['the', 'that', 'is', 'him', 'they', 'their']\n",

    "#   ['in', 'it', 'his', 'as', 'i', 's', 'if', 'its', 'us']\n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space for the second word.\n",

    "#\n",
    "# Probabilistic model:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Each sentence is modeled as a hidden Markov model, where the\n",
    "# hidden states are the words that the user intended to type, and\n",
    "# the emissions are the words that were actually typed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in a sentence, we can define:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - emission probabilities: P(observed word|intended word)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - prior probabilities (for first words in sentences only):\n",

    "#\n",
    "# Prior and transition probabilities were calculated in the pre-\n",
    "# processing steps above, using the same corpus as the dictionary.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Emission probabilities are calculated on the fly using a Poisson\n",
    "# distribution as follows:\n",
    "# P(observed word|intended word) = PMF of Poisson(k, l), where\n",
    "# k = edit distance between word typed and word intended, and l=0.01.\n",
    "# Both the overall approach and the parameter of l=0.01 are based on\n",
    "# the 2015 lecture notes from AM207 Stochastic Optimization.\n",
    "# Various parameters for lambda between 0 and 1 were tested, which\n",

    "#\n",
    "# Algorithm:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The spell-checking itself is carried out using a modified version\n",
    "# of the Viterbi algorithm, which yields the most likely sequence of\n",
    "# hidden states, i.e. the most likely sequence of words that form a\n",
    "# sentence. The main difference to the 'standard' Viterbi algorithm\n",
    "# is that the state space (i.e. the list of possible corrections) is\n",
    "# generated (and therefore varies) for each word. This is in contrast\n",
    "# to the alternative of considering the state space of all possible\n",
    "# words in the dictionary for every word that is checked, which would\n",
    "# be intractable for larger dictionaries.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm is best illustrated by way of an example.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Suppose that we are checking the sentence 'This is ax test.'\n",
    "# The emissions for the entire sentence are 'This is ax test.' and\n",
    "# the hidden states for the entire sentence are 'This is a test.'\n",
    "#\n",
    "# As a pre-processing step, we convert everything to lowercase,\n",
    "# eliminate punctuation, and break the sentence up into a list of\n",
    "# words: ['this', 'is', 'ax', 'text']\n",
    "# This list is passed as a parameter to the viterbi function.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm tackles each word in turn, starting with 'this'.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We first use get_suggestions to obtain a list of all words that\n",
    "# may have been intended instead of 'this', i.e. all possible hidden\n",
    "# states (intended words) for the emission (word typed).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# get_suggestions returns the 10 most likely corrections:\n",
    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",
    "#   ['this']\n",
    "# - 3 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['his', 'thus', 'thin']\n",
    "# - 6 words with an edit distance of 2 \n",
    "#   ['the', 'that', 'is', 'him', 'they', 'their']\n",
    "# \n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space, i.e. possible words that\n",
    "# may have been intended, and are referred to below as the list of\n",
    "# possible corrections. They each have an emission probability equal\n",
    "# to the PMF of Poisson(edit distance, 0.01).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in the list of possible corrections, we calculate:\n",
    "# P(word starting a sentence) * P(observed 'this'|intended word)\n",
    "# This is a simple application of Bayes' rule: by normalizing the\n",
    "# probabilities we obtain P(intended word|oberved 'this') for\n",
    "# each of the 10 words.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We store the word-probability pairs for future use, and move on to\n",
    "# the next word. \n",
    "#\n",
    "# After the first word, all subsequent words are treated as follows.\n",

    "# The second word in our test sentence is 'is'. Once again, we use\n",

    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",

    "# - 9 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['in', 'it', 'his', 'as', 'i', 's', 'if', 'its', 'us']\n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space for the second word.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in the current list of possible corrections, we loop\n",
    "# through all the words in the previous list of possible corrections,\n",

    "# This is the second attempt at parallelizing the Viterbi algorithm.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This implementation is inspired by the algorithm, but is not completely\n",
    "# faithful to it. \n",
    "#\n",
    "# For a given sentence, the Viterbi algorithm steps through each word\n",
    "# in turn. At each iteration, it assesses the combination of all\n",
    "# previous paths and the word currently under consideration, and only\n",
    "# stores the previous path with the highest probability. Consequently,\n",
    "# only a subset of the possible combinations of words are retained\n",
    "# by the last step.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In contrast, this implementation considers all the possible\n",
    "# sentences that could be created through combinations of all possible\n",
    "# corrections for all the words in a sentence.\n",
    "# e.g. \"This is a test\" -> if each word has 5 possible corrections,\n",
    "# then there are 5^4 possible resulting sentences.\n",
    "# We calculate the probability of each sentence (using the same concepts\n",
    "# of start probabilities, emission probabilities, and transition\n",
    "# probabilities) and choose the sentence (word combination) with the\n",
    "# highest probability.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# There are several problems with this implementation.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# First, as expected, this approach yields similar corrections to the\n",
    "# Viterbi algorithm in many cases, but not always. Despite not being\n",
    "# a compeletely faithful representation of the original algorithm,\n",
    "# this implementation was considered a way to experiement with a \n",
    "# different way of parallelixing the problem.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The second problem is more severe. Under this implementation, the\n",
    "# size of the problem grows exponentially with the size of the text\n",
    "# being checked (e.g. an 8-word sentence results in 10^8 possible\n",
    "# combinations). This not only makes the approach inefficient, but\n",
    "# (more importantly) means that it does not scale to larger problems.\n",

    "# Probabilistic model:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Each sentence is modeled as a hidden Markov model, where the\n",
    "# hidden states are the words that the user intended to type, and\n",
    "# the emissions are the words that were actually typed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in a sentence, we can define:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - emission probabilities: P(observed word|intended word)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - prior probabilities (for first words in sentences only):\n",

    "# Prior and transition probabilities were calculated in the pre-\n",
    "# processing steps above, using the same corpus as the dictionary.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Emission probabilities are calculated on the fly using a Poisson\n",
    "# distribution as follows:\n",
    "# P(observed word|intended word) = PMF of Poisson(k, l), where\n",
    "# k = edit distance between word typed and word intended, and l=0.01.\n",
    "# Both the overall approach and the parameter of l=0.01 are based on\n",
    "# the 2015 lecture notes from AM207 Stochastic Optimization.\n",
    "# Various parameters for lambda between 0 and 1 were tested, which\n",

    "#\n",
    "# Algorithm:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The spell-checking itself is carried out using a modified version\n",
    "# of the Viterbi algorithm, which yields the most likely sequence of\n",
    "# hidden states, i.e. the most likely sequence of words that form a\n",
    "# sentence. The main difference to the 'standard' Viterbi algorithm\n",
    "# is that the state space (i.e. the list of possible corrections) is\n",
    "# generated (and therefore varies) for each word. This is in contrast\n",
    "# to the alternative of considering the state space of all possible\n",
    "# words in the dictionary for every word that is checked, which would\n",
    "# be intractable for larger dictionaries.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm is best illustrated by way of an example.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Suppose that we are checking the sentence 'This is ax test.'\n",
    "# The emissions for the entire sentence are 'This is ax test.' and\n",
    "# the hidden states for the entire sentence are 'This is a test.'\n",
    "#\n",
    "# As a pre-processing step, we convert everything to lowercase,\n",
    "# eliminate punctuation, and break the sentence up into a list of\n",
    "# words: ['this', 'is', 'ax', 'text']\n",
    "# This list is passed as a parameter to the viterbi function.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm tackles each word in turn, starting with 'this'.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We first use get_suggestions to obtain a list of all words that\n",
    "# may have been intended instead of 'this', i.e. all possible hidden\n",
    "# states (intended words) for the emission (word typed).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# get_suggestions returns the 10 most likely corrections:\n",
    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",
    "#   ['this']\n",
    "# - 3 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['his', 'thus', 'thin']\n",
    "# - 6 words with an edit distance of 2 \n",
    "#   ['the', 'that', 'is', 'him', 'they', 'their']\n",
    "# \n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space, i.e. possible words that\n",
    "# may have been intended, and are referred to below as the list of\n",
    "# possible corrections. They each have an emission probability equal\n",
    "# to the PMF of Poisson(edit distance, 0.01).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in the list of possible corrections, we calculate:\n",
    "# P(word starting a sentence) * P(observed 'this'|intended word)\n",
    "# This is a simple application of Bayes' rule: by normalizing the\n",
    "# probabilities we obtain P(intended word|oberved 'this') for\n",
    "# each of the 10 words.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We store the word-probability pairs for future use, and move on to\n",
    "# the next word. \n",
    "#\n",
    "# After the first word, all subsequent words are treated as follows.\n",

    "# The second word in our test sentence is 'is'. Once again, we use\n",

    "# intended. get_suggestions returns the 10 most likely suggestions:\n",
    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",
    "#   ['is']\n",
    "# - 9 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['in', 'it', 'his', 'as', 'i', 's', 'if', 'its', 'us']\n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space for the second word.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in the current list of possible corrections, we loop\n",
    "# through all the words in the previous list of possible corrections,\n",
