v 1.0a last revised 5 Dec 2015

This program is a Spark (PySpark) version of a spellchecker based on SymSpell, 
a Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm developed by Wolf Garbe 
and originally written in C#.

From the original SymSpell documentation:

"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity 
 of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-
 Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language 
 independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, 
 no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the 
 input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.
 Replaces and inserts are expensive and language dependent: 
 e.g. Chinese has 70,000 Unicode Han characters!"

For further information on SymSpell, please consult the original documentation:
  URL: blog.faroo.com/2012/06/07/improved-edit-distance-based-spelling-correction/
  Description: blog.faroo.com/2012/06/07/improved-edit-distance-based-spelling-correction/

The current version of this program will output all possible suggestions for
corrections up to an edit distance (configurable) of max_edit_distance = 3. 

Future improvements may entail allowing for less verbose options, 
including the output of a single recommended correction. Note also that we
have generally kept to the form of the original program, and have not
introduced any major optimizations or structural changes in this PySpark port.

Note: we did not implement entire document checking given speed of program,
      since we are parallelizing the processing of deletions of the input word
      (however, see later Spark version).

    This distance is the number of additions, deletions, substitutions,
    and transpositions needed to transform the first sequence into the
    second. Although generally used with strings, any sequences of
    comparable objects will work.

    Transpositions are exchanges of *consecutive* characters; all other

    This implementation is O(N*M) time and O(M) space, for N and M the

    >>> dameraulevenshtein('fee', 'deed')
