    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",
    " of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-\n",
    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",

    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",

    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",
    " input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.\n",

    "introduced any major optimizations or structural changes in this PySpark port.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute program:\n",
    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

    "\n",
    "From the original SymSpell documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",
    " of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-\n",
    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",
    " input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.\n",
    " Replaces and inserts are expensive and language dependent: \n",

    "Future improvements may entail allowing for less verbose options, \n",

    "have generally kept to the form of the original program, and have not\n",
    "introduced any major optimizations or structural changes in this PySpark port.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute program:\n",
    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",

    "  This version parallelizes the word check for all the words in a document, using word-level correction. Since SPARK does not permit RDD manipulation from within an RDD transformation (i.e. no parallelism within a parallel task), we converted the `get_suggestions` function that acts on an individual word to a serial method. This allows us to then parallelize across multiple words in a document. <i>This is a reasonable trade off when the number of words in a document is much larger compared to the number of suggestions that will likely be found for any given word)</i>. <br><p>\n",
    "  Also note the (modified) `no_RDD_get_suggestions` function still returns an entire list of all possible suggestions to the calling function (e.g. for context checking), even if only the top match is used or required. Future improvements may be made to `no_RDD_get_suggestions` to terminate early once a \"top\" match (e.g. minimum edit distance) is found; a speedup in that function will in turn lead to a performance improvement of the document checking function as well.\n",
