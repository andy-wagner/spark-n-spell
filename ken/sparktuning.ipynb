    "This program is a Python version of a spellchecker based on SymSpell, \n",
    "a Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm developed by Wolf Garbe \n",

    "\n",
    "From the original SymSpell documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",
    " of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-\n",
    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",
    " input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.\n",
    " Replaces and inserts are expensive and language dependent: \n",

    "introduced any major optimizations or structural changes in this Python port.\n",

    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",

    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",

    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",

    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",
