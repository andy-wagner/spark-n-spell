    "This program is a Python version of a spellchecker based on SymSpell, \n",
    "a Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm developed by Wolf Garbe \n",

    "\n",
    "From the original SymSpell documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",
    " of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-\n",
    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",
    " input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.\n",
    " Replaces and inserts are expensive and language dependent: \n",

    "introduced any major optimizations or structural changes in this Python port.\n",

    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",

    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",

    "Future improvements may entail allowing for less verbose options, \n",

    "introduced any major optimizations or structural changes in this PySpark port.\n",

    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

    "From the original SymSpell documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity \n",
    " of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-\n",
    " Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language \n",
    " independent. Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, \n",
    " no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the \n",
    " input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.\n",

    "1. Ensure \"big.txt\" is in the current working directory. This is the corpus\n",

Since SPARK does not permit RDD manipulation from within an RDD transformation (i.e. no parallelism within a parallel task), we converted the `get_suggestions` function that acts on an individual word to a serial method. This allows us to then parallelize across multiple words in a document. <i>This is a reasonable trade off when the number of words in a document is much larger compared to the number of suggestions that will likely be found for any given word)</i>. <br><p>\n",

Future improvements may be made to `no_RDD_get_suggestions` to terminate early once a \"top\" match (e.g. minimum edit distance) is found; a speedup in that function will in turn lead to a performance improvement of the document checking function as well.\n",
